# Harness engineering notes (mapping to Enkidu)

Harness engineering is the discipline of building the environment so coding agents can ship reliably:
- repo structure
- docs as system-of-record
- feedback loops (tests, CI, observability)
- throughput-aware merge philosophy

Enkidu takes those ideas and turns them into a reusable workflow + toolchain:
- worktree isolation
- merge trains
- context graph + memory
- governance policies
- quality ratchet via scorecards
