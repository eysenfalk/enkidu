# ADR-0001: Project name and scope

**Date:** 2026-02-21  
**Status:** accepted

## Context

We need a name for the harness/orchestrator that:
- coordinates multiple AI agents
- enforces gates, governance, and quality improvements
- balances speed with restraint

Candidates:
- “Gilgamesh”
- “Enkidu”

## Decision

Name the project **Enkidu**.

## Rationale

Enkidu is the companion/conscience archetype: it restrains reckless power and turns brute capability into civilization.

That’s precisely the goal of an engineering harness for autonomous coding agents.

## Consequences

- “Enkidu” becomes the orchestrator/harness name.
- “Gilgamesh” can remain an optional umbrella name for a larger suite if needed later.
